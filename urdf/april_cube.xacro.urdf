  <!-- a foam cube of given size with one centered apriltag of given 
       marker_size centered on each of the six faces.

       Note that our apriltag textures include the white border around
       the actual pattern (100x100 pixels total, with 80x80 pixels pattern).
       For example, our demo cubes are 70x70x70 mm diameter, and this
       needs to be specified here for marker_size. The apriltags node
       instead want the "internal" size, which is 0.056 (0.07*80/100)  
       in this case.

  <!-- ROS xacro/urdf model of one apriltag marker with given
       tag-family, ID, and size of the mesh. Optionally, apriltag_size can be 
       specified to calculate from it the size of the mesh. In this case, the 
       parameter "size" will be ignored. The marker is modeled as 
       a simple box with outer xy diameter as specified, and z 1mm thickness.
       The marker is centered and can be added to other xacro/urdf
       models. 
       The mesh of the model contains one bit wide white borders. Therefore,
       the actual size of the apriltag will be:
       8/10*size in case of 36h11
       6/8 *size in case of 16h5
       This is due to the usage of the white border in the 
       apriltag detection algorithm, even though its size
       does not have a convention.

       2019.10.10 - fix Collada rotation, ooops
       2019.05.22 - switch to textured Collada meshes, needs Jade or higher
       2014.11.24 - created
       2021.11.10 - added include_borders parameter 
       (C) 2014 fnh, hendrich@informatik.uni-hamburg.de

       Usage:
       size - size of the mesh 
       apriltag_size - size of the apriltag. If this parameter is set, the size 
       of the mesh will be re-calculated as mentioned above

       <xacro:apriltag_marker namespace="doro/" name="apriltag13" parent="base_link" 
              family="36h11" ID="00013" size="0.33" >
         <origin xyz="0.2 0.3 05" rpy="0 0 3.14" />

       <xacro:apriltag_marker namespace="doro/" name="apriltag14" parent="base_link" 
              family="36h11" ID="00014" apriltag_size="0.05">
         <origin xyz="0.2 0.3 05" rpy="0 0 3.14" />
       </xacro:apriltag_marker>

       The following definition does not make much sense and will produce the same result
       as the one above with ID=00014, because the mesh is predefined and the size of the 
       border will not be recalculated.
       <xacro:apriltag_marker namespace="doro/" name="apriltag14" parent="base_link" 
              family="36h11" ID="00014" size="0.33" apriltag_size="0.05">
         <origin xyz="0.2 0.3 05" rpy="0 0 3.14" />
       </xacro:apriltag_marker>
